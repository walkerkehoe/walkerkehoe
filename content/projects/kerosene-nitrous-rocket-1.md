### Overview

The [Stanford Student Space Initiative](https://stanfordssi.org/) (SSI) is the school's largest project-based student group and comprises teams ranging from high altitude balloons to astrobiology. As part of the Olympus project, I participated in the development and testing of a 1.5 kN thrust liquid engine rocket. [Version 1](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/6.2019-4231) of the engine was designed, built and hot fired in 2018. When I joined the project, the team was focused on iterating the design and getting the rocket ready for the Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition (IREC) and Friends of Amateur Rocketry (FAR) Mars Competition, both scheduled for summer 2020.

I began on this project by machining key components of the rocket that had been destroyed in a previous hot fire test anomaly. Once it was clear that IREC and FAR Mars would be postponed due to COVID-19, the team transitioned efforts to redesigning the engine. The goals of the redesign were to:

* Reduce weight
* Reduce cost
* Improve manufacturability (notice the chatter marks on the part pictured above) and make assembly easier
* Reduce time between tests for quicker design iterations
* Add a throttling feature

### Reducing Weight

As a competition rocket, every gram counts, and though the original design was optimized to be as light as possible, a lot was still unknown until after the hot fire tests, which provided real data to better characterize the rocket. The results highlighted parts that could be made even lighter, either through a change in geometrical design or material selection, or even removed altogether. For example, the original injector was manufactured through direct metal laser sintering of Inconel 718. This superalloy, chosen for its high strength and thermal properties, is also quite heavy. But perhaps we could achieve the same pressure and thermal loads through a different design, perhaps with a creative trick like pairing a highly conductive metal with regenerative cooling. 

Another area that we realized carried extra weight was the pyrovalve assembly. In the original design, 

### Reducing Cost

This often went hand in hand with weight reduction--Inconel is one of the more expensive materials to 3D print--
