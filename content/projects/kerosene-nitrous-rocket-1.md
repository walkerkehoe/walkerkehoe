The [Stanford Student Space Initiative](https://stanfordssi.org/) (SSI) is the school's largest project-based student group and comprises teams ranging from high altitude balloons to astrobiology. As part of the Olympus project, I participated in the development and testing of a 1.5 kN thrust liquid engine rocket. [Version 1](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/6.2019-4231) of the engine was designed, built and hot fired in 2018. When I joined the project, the team was focused on iterating the design and getting the rocket ready for the Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition (IREC) and Friends of Amateur Rocketry (FAR) Mars Competition, both scheduled for summer 2020.

I began on this project by machining key components of the rocket that had been destroyed in a previous hot fire test anomaly. Once it was clear that IREC and FAR Mars would be postponed due to COVID-19, the team transitioned efforts to redesigning the engine. The goals of the redesign were to:

* Reduce weight
* Reduce cost
* Improve manufacturability (notice the chatter marks on the part pictured above)
* Make assembly easier
* Reduce time between tests for quicker design iterations
