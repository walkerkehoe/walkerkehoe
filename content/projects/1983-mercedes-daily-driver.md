Keeping a nearly 40-year-old diesel alive is hard work! Especially when you need to drive it to work every day. I've done all the maintenance on it myself:

* Front and rear suspension rebuild
* Rear axle replacement
* New alternator
* Rear window gasket replacement
* Engine and transmission mounts
* Belt replacement
* Hoses: fuel, power steering, transmission oil cooler, oil cooler
* Manifold gasket
* Air conditioning system overhaul
* Glow plugs
* Filters
* Countless oil changes
