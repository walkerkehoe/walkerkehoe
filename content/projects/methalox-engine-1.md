### Introduction

In January of 2020 I began designing a liquid oxygen/methane rocket engine for Stanford's AA 284B - Propulsion System Design Laboratory class. My team and I completed the design and engineering drawings in ten weeks but shortly after passing our Critical Design Review (CDR), the Stanford administration enacted a school-wide shutdown in response to COVID-19 and cancelled the project.
