### Introduction

In January of 2020 I began designing a liquid oxygen/methane rocket engine for a class at Stanford. The goal was to do a hot fire test demonstrating the engine's restart capabilities at the end of May. My team and I finalized the design and completed engineering drawings, but shortly after passing Critical Design Review (CDR) the project was cancelled due to a school-wide shutdown in response to COVID-19. See the [blog](https://walkerkehoe-6085c.netlify.com/blog/) for updates on how I've independently continued the project while quarantining. Keep reading below for a deep dive on the design.

### Project Goal

Hot fire test(s) demonstrating startup, shutdown and restart of a liquid oxygen/gaseous methane rocket engine.

**Stretch Goals**

* Stable combustion (defined as a chamber pressure oscillation <5% from mean)
* Measure C* efficiency
* Image engine startup and reignition

_Initially we were planning on using liquid methane but were unable to source it._
