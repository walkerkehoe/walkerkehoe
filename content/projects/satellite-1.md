The PyCubed-1 is a satellite I built while at Stanford that, at 50x50x50cm^3, is the smallest ever spacecraft with three axis attitude determination and control. Full documentation can be found on the project's [GitHub page](https://github.com/spacecraft-design-lab-2019). The satellite launches in Q4 2020 on a rideshare mission and is pictured here in its custom vibration testing fixture.
