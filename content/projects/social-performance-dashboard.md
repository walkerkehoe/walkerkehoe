In between my time at the consulting firm and graduate school, I spent a year volunteering for a financial inclusion nonprofit in South Africa. One of my projects there was to build a tool that could help track social outcomes of the organizationâ€™s microfinance lending program. You can play with an interactive version of the dashboard [here](https://walkerkehoe.shinyapps.io/socialperformance/).
