### Overview

In between my time at the consulting firm and graduate school, I spent a year volunteering for a financial inclusion nonprofit in South Africa. One of my projects there was to build a tool that could help track social outcomes of the organizationâ€™s microfinance lending program. You can play with an interactive version of the dashboard [here](https://walkerkehoe.shinyapps.io/socialperformance/).

### Defining Metrics

As a bank, they were good at tracking financial performance, using measures like rate of repayment and total outstanding portfolio, but quantifying social outcomes proved more challenging. We started by taking an inventory of all the data the organization was collecting on its clients. With this list we were able to brainstorm some high level social metrics we thought were trackable:

* Number of clients
* Client poverty assessment
* Amount client has in savings
* Client business value
