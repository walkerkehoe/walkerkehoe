The raceway is an assembly of tubes and avionics harnesses that carry gas and electrons between the forward and aft end of Starship. One of the major challenges with the suborbital raceway design was that each tube and harness needed to be individually integrated on-vehicle, resulting in a very long install time. 

For orbital starship, I was tasked with redesigning the raceway to shorten install time and withstand the increased loads caused by ascent and atmospheric re-entry.
