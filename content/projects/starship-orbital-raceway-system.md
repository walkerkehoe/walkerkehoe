The raceway is an assembly of tubes and avionics harnesses that carry gas and electrons between the forward and aft end of Starship. One of the major challenges with the suborbital raceway design was that each tube and harness needed to be individually integrated on-vehicle, resulting in a very long install time. 

For orbital starship, I was tasked with redesigning the raceway to shorten install time and withstand the increased loads caused by ascent and atmospheric re-entry. Inspired by automotive manufacturing, I chose to turn the raceway into a modular subassembly that gets put together on the ground and then lifted and installed as once single piece onto the vehicle. I owned this project "cradle to grave" and was responsible for design, analysis, testing, tool design, build and final install. The result was a reduction of part count by 50% and install time by 70% compared with the suborbital raceway, along with positive margins to the orbital loads.
