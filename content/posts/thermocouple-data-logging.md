My soldering octopus came in the mail today, along with the thermocouple connectors so I was able to solder terminal blocks onto the thermocouple amplifier and Micro SD breakout boards. I was on a roll so I decided to see how far I could get writing code to log temperature measurements on the SD card. This is my first time ever writing Arduino code but luckily there are lots of examples online and I was able to pretty quickly copy and paste a piece of Frankenstein code together.
