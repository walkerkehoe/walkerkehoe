Stanford has officially cancelled AA284C and consequently the [restart capable methalox biprop project](https://www.walkerkehoe.com/projects/methalox-engine-1/) has been put on indefinite hold. This was disappointing but inevitable news given the escalating COVID-19 situation, as the majority of work in the class would need to be performed in-person.

Luckily I have a backup plan: build the augmented spark igniter (ASI) in my garage.

My number one concern with this is safety. But because this is a simpler, less energetic system that doesn't involve cryogenic oxygen, doing it safely will be easier.

My second question is, will I be able to source all of the components? I went through the Bill of Materials earlier today and the majority of components are sourced from either McMaster or Amazon, both essential businesses. Two potential issues are:

1. Sourcing the compressed gas bottles. The oxygen and nitrogen should be relatively easy to get from a welding shop but methane may prove more difficult to source. 
2. Machining the igniter body. With campus closed I no longer have access to a machine shop so I may need to outsource the machined igniter body to a company like Protolabs.
