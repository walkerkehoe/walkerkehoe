Goodies have been showing up this week! I could have sworn I had a soldering iron from my days of building Stratocasters back in high school but I couldn't find it anywhere. It will be good to get started on the avionics because I have a feeling debugging might take a lot of time.

Once the RCEXL Ignition kit arrives I'll get to work building an Arduino controlled spark plug.
