My RCEXL ignition kit arrived in the mail yesterday so I rigged up a quick test to see if I could get it to spark. I didn't have any alligator clip wires on hand, hence the sketchy electrical taped jumper wire grounding the spark plug. Next step is to write some Arduino code that can turn the system on and off.
