The igniter body arrived today! Big thanks to Protolabs for sponsoring the part--this project would not have been possible without their help! The material is Inconel 718 and it was 3D printed using direct metal laser sintering (DMLS). The threads and sealing surfaces were then post-machined. I can't wait to test it out!
